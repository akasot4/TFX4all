# TFX4all
Tensorflow Extended - the power of AI combined with the pragmatism and control of a succesful business.

With the goal of integrating AI and a business setup, for everyday data analysis and decision making in general, TFX turns out to be an extremelly useful tool, since it allows heavy control and pragmatism to come into play when doing machine learning, what is just crucial to any business application.

Is brings reliability and a clear path to the one who is interested in actually setting data analysis as a principal role in the decision making process, but keeps the flexibility and power of tensorflow, what makes it an absolutely powerful tool.

The Machine Learning process is treated by TFX pretty much as a line of production, where the final goal is the best model that your resources allow to be created. A lot of technical matters are actually fully held by TFX, what brings confidence and consistence to every project, since there will not happen any mistakes at those parts, and also leaves the modeler with more time to actually think about the model design, without being worried about technical issues or errors, non-optimality conditions at the process, etc.

This line of production of which we talk about is made of several components: ExempleGen, StatisticsGen, SchemaGen, Trainer, etc, and upon those TFX puts to work all the theory for machine learning processing, model validation, and so on. Is also makes available lots of visualizations that helps the modeler and also prevents him to lose some time coding anything related to this.

The idea of this repository is to put this TFX machinery to use, and test it as a general data analysis framework for any kind of data (of different origins and characteristics). The final goal in then to be able to handle a lot of different and general type data in a fast, consistent and reliable manner.
